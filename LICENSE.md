# Lichtara License v4.1

This repository is governed by the **Lichtara License v4.1**, the supreme normative instrument of the LICHTARA System.

The authoritative, citable, and timestamped version of the License is published on Zenodo:

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18010273](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18010273)

This repository mirrors and supports the License text and annexes but does not supersede the published record.

## Key Principles

* The LICHTARA System is a governed living system.
* Access does not imply authorization.
* Comprehension does not imply permission to operate.
* Responsibility is proportional to the level of access exercised.
* Preservation of Form is a non-negotiable condition.

Where Form is not preserved, there is no System.
